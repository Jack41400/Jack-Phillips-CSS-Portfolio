## Summary

Starting off I used pintrest to collect some ideas on portfolio webpages. I also tried to find good font combinations and a color pallet. I also drew out a rough sketch on paper. I did make a few changes.

I started off working on the header. At this point I did not understand the flex properites too well. I could probably go back in and do some updating but I got it looking the way I wanted it to.

![Hey! I'm Jack. I am a Front-End Web Developer](./Assets/Images/text_capture.JPG)

I took a long time getting this text to sit the way I wanted. This is another element I could do some cleaning up on but I got it to look how I wanted. on a screen width of 1225px or less the text wraps above the Recent Photo.

## What I learned

After completing the project my understanding of the display flex properties increased dramatically. I also have a good grasp on the @media querey now.
